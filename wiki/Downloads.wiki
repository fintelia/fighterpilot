*System Requirements:*
  * Windows Operating System
  * Reasonably fast computer
  * OpenGL 2.0 compatible graphics card

Simply unzip the file and run _FighterPilot.exe_. Then choose high graphics settings (if this runs too slowly, then try low graphics settings). Once the loading bar finishes you will see the main menu. Use the arrow keys and Space/Enter to navigate the menu. To exit from the main menu, press the escape key. Pressing the escape key while in the game will bring up the in-game menu. The flight controls are as follows:

*Note: If one or more Xbox 360 controllers are attached to the system these will be used instead of the keyboard controls for their respective players.*
