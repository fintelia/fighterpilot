~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ GENERAL ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	FighterPilot is a combat flight simulator in which players fly a
	fourth generation jet aircraft on a series of missions to eliminate
	enemy targets. As the pilot of a Dassault Mirage 2000, players face
	a range of enemies from hostile aircraft to ground based defenses.
	And thanks to arcade style controls, you can be flying in minutes!

	The single player mode takes you through a seven level campaign,
	challenging you with the task of eliminating a series of increasingly
	difficult adversaries. In multiplayer mode, a split screen view allows
	two players to play together on a single computer. Players can either
	compete against each other, or they can work cooperatively to complete
	levels of the campaign. Finally, a built in level editor lets you
	create your own custom levels.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ GETTING STARTED ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Under Windows simply extract the download, then run FighterPilot.exe
	(Linux users see below)

	Once the loading bar finishes you will see the main menu. Use the
	arrow keys and Space/Enter to navigate the menu. To exit from the
	main menu, press the escape key. Pressing escape while in the game
	will bring up the in-game menu. If you want to play a map other than
	the default, press <Ctrl> + <Enter> in the main menu. At the main
	menu press F1 for help, or F3 to edit game settings.

	it will be used in addition to the keyboard controls for the active
	player. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ LINUX ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	To play FighterPilot on Linux, use Subversion to checkout a copy of
	the source code from the sourceforge repository. Then, generate a
	makefile using cmake and compile. If all goes well, you should be able
	to run the generated executable file (which is named 'FighterPilot'). 
	
	I have only tested FighterPilot on Ubuntu 12.10, so it may or may not
	work on other distributions. You will probably have to install several
	libraries (boost, zlib, etc.) in order to get it to link properly.
